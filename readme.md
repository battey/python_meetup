Welcome Python coder! 

Congratulations for getting here early. In this repo you'll find sample json files for Gracenote Music Metadata, and a test script.  Please run the test script on your machine to make sure you can run the `json` and `requests` libraries.  This project is designed for Python 2.7.

First, clone the repo using:

`git clone https://github.com/gracenote/python_meetup.git`

Then navigate to the directory:

`cd python_meetup`

And run the test scripts:

`python test_script.py`

The output should look like this:

`Requests test result: True`

`Json test result: Taylor Swift`
